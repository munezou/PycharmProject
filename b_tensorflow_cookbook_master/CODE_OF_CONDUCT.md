# Contributor Code of Conduct

## For the TensorFlow Machine Learning Cookbook

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This code of conduct applies to all of the projects under this [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/nfmcclure/tensorflow_cookbook) and any related community interactions (Stackoverflow, Google Plus, Email, Comments, Twitter, etc...).

## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Diversity and inclusion is a vital element to the success of open source and the tech community. Freedom of thought and the open exchange of ideas are key to an effective learning environment and central to the tech community (and all interactions at large). This kind of environment can only happen in a culture that recognizes the value of each person and fosters mutual respect.

## Code of Conduct

Our community is dedicated to creating an inclusive open-source environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, skin color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, health (physical or mental), genetic information, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, veteran status, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing. Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.

Our community does not tolerate harassment in any form towards any person. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention (even without sexual contact). Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community members violating this code will be addressed fairly and expediently. Violators may be sanctioned or removed from community spaces (Comments, issues, links, etc... removed).

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please immediately contact the project owner: `nfmcclure (at) gmail.com `.
